## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Web browser
- Internet connection

## üì• Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Run `install library.bat` to install the required dependencies
3. Or manually install dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Compiling to Executable
If you want to create an executable (.exe) version of the application:

1. Make sure you have PyInstaller installed:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Compile the application using:
   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Magic.ico --name="Giveaway_IG" --add-data "config.ini;." --add-data "traduction.json;." --add-data "List-Uncheck.csv;." --version-file=file_version_info.txt Giveaway_IG.py
   ```

3. Find the compiled executable in the `dist` folder

> [!NOTE]
> To achieve a portable-executable format, the application is packaged with PyInstaller into an `EXE`. Some antivirus engines (including Windows Defender) might report the packaged executable as a trojan, because PyInstaller has been used by others to package malicious Python code in the past. These reports can be safely ignored. If you absolutely do not trust the executable, you'll have to install Python yourself and run everything from source.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Run the program using `run.bat` or by executing `python Giveaway_IG.py`
2. Select your preferred language
3. Choose a CSV file containing the giveaway URLs (default: List-Uncheck.csv)
4. Set the time interval between each URL
5. The program will open each valid giveaway URL in your browser
6. Click on the orange "Participate" button in the center of each page

## üìÅ File Structure
- `Giveaway_IG.py`: Main program file
- `traduction.json`: Contains translations for multiple languages
- `List-Uncheck.csv`: Default list of URLs to check. Some contests may be sourced from [this contest list](https://github.com/enzomtpYT/InstantGamingGiveawayList).
- `valid_urls.csv`: List of valid giveaway URLs
- `invalid_urls.csv`: List of expired or invalid URLs
- `unknown_urls.csv`: List of URLs with unknown status

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues with loading translations, check the JSON format in the translation files
- Make sure your CSV files are properly formatted with one URL per line
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
